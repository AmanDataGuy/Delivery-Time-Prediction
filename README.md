# Delivery-Time-Prediction
ðŸ§ Predicting delivery time between two locations using regression models and real-world features such as rider, vehicle, weather, and traffic data.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the time (in minutes) it takes for a food delivery to reach the customer after being dispatched.

The problem is approached as a supervised regression task, where we use input features such as:

- Rider details (experience, ratings, etc.) <br>

- Vehicle type

- Weather and traffic conditions

- Restaurant and delivery locations

- The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict delivery times and help businesses improve efficiency, transparency, and customer satisfaction.

##  Why This Project Matters

In a food delivery system, even a few minutes of delay can affect customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
By predicting delivery times accurately, this project can help:

-  Customers â†’ get reliable ETAs and fewer late deliveries

-  Riders â†’ plan routes better and manage multiple deliveries efficiently

-  Restaurants â†’ prioritize orders and manage staff based on predicted delivery times

-  Companies â†’ optimize resources and reduce delivery costs

  ## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, remove inconsistencies, and standardize data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Study distributions, detect outliers, and visualize relationships between variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create new predictive features (distance, weather impact, time of day, etc.) and encode categorical data.

4. **Model Building and Evaluation**  
   Train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluate using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

5. **Insights and Reporting**  
   Analyze model performance and highlight factors that most influence delivery time.
